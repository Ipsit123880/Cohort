// async: This keyword is used to define an asynchronous function. It allows the use of await inside the function to handle promises.
// const response = await fetch("https://fakerapi.it/api/v1/persons");:

// fetch("https://fakerapi.it/api/v1/persons"): The fetch function is a modern JavaScript API for making HTTP requests.
// It returns a Promise that resolves to the Response to that request, whether it is successful or not.
// await: This keyword is used to wait for the resolution of the Promise returned by fetch. It can only be used inside an async function.
// It pauses the execution of the function until the Promise is resolved.
// const finalData = await response.json();:

// response.json(): The json() method of the Response object is an asynchronous method that reads the response body to
// completion and parses the body text as JSON. It also returns a Promise.
// await: Similar to the previous usage, it's used to wait for the Promise returned by response.json() to be resolved.
// console.log(finalData);:

// console.log(): This is a function used to log the data to the console.
// finalData: This is the variable that holds the parsed JSON data obtained from the response body.
// Putting it all together, the getAnimalData function is an asynchronous function that fetches data from the specified URL,
// waits for the response, parses the response body as JSON, and then logs the final parsed data to the console.
// The await keyword is crucial for managing asynchronous code in a readable and sequential manner.

// Synchronous vs. Asynchronous:

// In programming, operations are either synchronous or asynchronous.
// Synchronous operations: Execute one after the other, and each operation must finish before the next one starts.
// Asynchronous operations: Can start, run in the background, and finish independently of the main program flow.
// Asynchronous Nature of JavaScript:

// JavaScript is a single-threaded language, meaning it executes one operation at a time in a sequence.
// However, JavaScript can handle asynchronous tasks efficiently through the use of events and callbacks.
// Async Functions and Promises:

// An asynchronous function is a type of function in JavaScript that allows you to work with asynchronous code more easily.
// Async functions are defined using the async keyword before the function keyword.
// Example of Asynchronous Code:

// Consider fetching data from an external source (e.g., an API).
// In synchronous code, you would have to wait for the data to arrive before moving on to the next task, potentially 
// causing the program to freeze.
// With asynchronous code, you can continue with other tasks while waiting for the data to arrive.
// Using async and await:

// The async keyword is used to define an asynchronous function.
// The await keyword is used inside an async function to wait for the completion of
